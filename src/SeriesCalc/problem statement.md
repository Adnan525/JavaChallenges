Java Loops II

We use the integers a, b, and n to create the following series:

(a+2^0.b), (a+2^0.b+2^1.b),.........., (a+2^0.b+2^1.b+....+2^(n-1).b)

You are given q queries in the form of a, b, and n. For each query, print the series corresponding to the
given a, b, and n values as a single line of space-separated integers.
